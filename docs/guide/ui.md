# UI Plugin
The ui plugin is currently new so has a limited amount of uses but over time, this will change and we will update the documentation when new features are added. You can currently access full screen mode and check for the prescence of mobile devices.

## Loading Plugin
To load the ui plugin from the `plugins/core` directory, use the following code:

```js

```

Below is an example of how to use the ui plugin functions:

// Check if the device is mobile
if (plugin.ui.isMobile()) {
  console.log("Mobile device detected");
} else {
  console.log("Desktop device detected");
}

// Toggle fullscreen mode
plugin.ui.fullScreen();
```
